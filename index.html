      //i need a functional lesson...
      //if you look at justDraw/justGraph-things'.js, they appear to be stacks of commands
      //is there a way to create functional graphical apis?
      //do functional graphical apis already exist? How does it work?
      //how would one work if it doesn't exist already?
      //in my mind I would think that the thing that I'm drawing would exist in data somewhere, and that would be the return value from drawing something.
      //in the main loop, you would recurse, events would fire, and values would be returned from events, passing changed values for the draw method to render
      //is this something that can be done?
      //for example: (pseudocode)
      //
      //let blocks = [b1,b2,b3]
      //draw(blocks):
      //  --do something with the graphics
      //  --such as a 3d rotate
      //  let newState = blocks.map(b=>rotate(b));
      //
      //  if(event): newState.push(newBlock)
      //  if(notEOF): draw(newState);
      //  else
      //Can someone splain me plz?
